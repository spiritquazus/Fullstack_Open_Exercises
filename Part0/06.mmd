    Note right of user: user inputs a value (or none) in the input element of type text, then presses the linked submit button. Browser handles the next process.
    Note right of browser: The browser submits a POST request to "/new_note_spa" end point. However, because the event listener has an anonymous function this time with e.preventDefault(), the default behavior of page refresh does not occur.
    Note right of browser: The browser instead calls a different function called redrawNotes() which will recreate the <ul> element and populate it with each <li> based on the notes array, then immediately update the "notes" <div> container.
